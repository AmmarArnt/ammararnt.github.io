> My professional resume available at ðŸ‘‰ [https://arnautovic.dev](https://arnautovic.dev)

Built with:

1. **Github Pages** for hosting
2. Free HTML template: [Orbit](https://themes.3rdwavemedia.com/bootstrap-templates/resume/orbit-free-resume-cv-bootstrap-theme-for-developers/) by Xiaoying Riley
3. [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) for:
   1. free SSL certificate
   2. Email address forwarded to my personal gmail
4. [favicon.io](https://favicon.io) for generating favicons

All of the above are free, so the only thing that I needed to pay for is the domain `arnautovic.dev` at [GoDaddy](https://godaddy.com).
